# LinkedList

# I have implemented LinkedList using python programming language
# the following methods of the list are `
#   1. popEnd deleting node from the end
#   2. popFront deleting node from the beginning
#   3. pushBack adding node form the end
#   4. reverseList to reverse Linked List 
#       example ` a -> b -> c -> None  TO  c -> b -> a -> None`
#   5. displayList to display list from front to end
